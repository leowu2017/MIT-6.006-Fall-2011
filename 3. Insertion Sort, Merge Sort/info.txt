3. Insertion Sort, Merge Sort

a. Insertion sort
time complexity: θ(n ^ 2)
memory comlexity: θ(1)

b. Insertion sort with binary search
if memory swaping time can be ignored compared to value comparison,
time complexity: θ(n * lg(n))
memory comlexity: θ(1)

c. Merge sort
time complexity: θ(n * lg(n))
memory comlexity: θ(n)
